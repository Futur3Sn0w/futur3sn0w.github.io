This week, after looking at the new colors in the Android 12 Developer Preview, I decided to redesign Quinn from Snazzy Labs’ logo.<br>
SL’s logo has previously had a nice, simple logo, which matched the brand quite well. The changes I made bring it into the modern age, and give it a nice & simplistic look and feel.<br>
As mentioned earlier, the colors are inspired by the colors of Android’s Developer Preview, and the new Material Design 2 look. The muted blue colors make for a modern yet, classy feel.<br>
I also used 2 different fonts for the tag name, while mirroring the colors from the logo itself.<br><br>
