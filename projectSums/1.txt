My live Portfolio project (idea by Noah Evans) is a solution to storing all of my concepts and creations in one place.<br>
Although Twitter is a great place to post my creations, after a while, old projects get difficult to view and look at. Additionally, due to compression, my concepts may not always be of the highest possible quality.<br><br>
This is where the Live Portfolio comes in!<br><br>
You can view all of my old and new final concept images. The album is chronological (from newest to oldest), so youâ€™ll always find the newest stuff at the top of the page.<br>
As you scroll down, you can click on any image to view it closer, as well as to view information about it.<br><br>
Check it out, and let me know your thoughts on Twitter!<br>
