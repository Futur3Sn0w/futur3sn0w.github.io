A few days ago, I posted about a setup I made that uses your album artwork to create a color pallete, which applies to your home screen. All of which was done in KLWP. If you missed the setup, you can check it out below!<br><br>
Today, I’m making an update to that setup! This setup is called SpinningColors, and is a feature update to KustomKolors.<br>
There are only a few major changes in this update, the biggest of which include a new layout (with no border), semicircles replacing the large boxes, and a cool spinning animation for the circles. Also notable, the colors themselves are now simply customizable colors, instead of being pulled from the album art. More on this in a bit.<br>
So, for the namesake ‘SpinningColors’, you may notice that the gradient in the images of the circles are at a strange angle. This is due to the spinning of the circles, which allows the gradient to spin, creating a live/dynamic effect on your home screen. It’s super low-profile, and isn’t distracting or messy. It honestly feels like something you could get as a stock wallpaper.<br>
As far as colors go, I mentioned before that the colors don’t pull from anywhere, and instead are user-choosable colors. The biggest reason for this is because, for the first time, you can actually download this KLWP preset at the link below!<br>
The addition of user replaceable colors makes it much simpler to make a color theme that you want, as well as match it to colors of your wallpaper, if you so choose.<br><br>
That’s about it! You can view some more information on Twitter, or you can download and use the KLWP preset, both from the links below!
