            <p class="chunk">Hey there! I'm Gavin, known online as Futur3Sn0w.
                <br>
                <br>
                I've been a technological explorer for over 10 years; creating on the web since I was around 12, and
                have
                been tinkering with toy pianos and making melodies before I was familiar with a computer. There's
                something
                a bit magical about being able to both love what you do, AND do what you love, and I hope to detail that
                in
                my work!
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>I primarily design</b> icons, wallpapers, web interfaces, and other graphics & media with people
                around
                the world. I do
                some niche projects, reimagining otherwise unattainable graphics, creating concept user interfaces, and
                redesigning existing graphics and concepts with modernity and class. My flagship work focuses on
                showcasing
                a range of design principles in a way that feels as native as possible to the source.
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>Creation</b> plays such a crucial role in my view of the world, from colors to shapes to layouts and
                more. My
                early work is iterative; I taught myself to replicating what I saw effectively using the tools I had on
                hand. It was the best way to teach myself what I liked and didn't like, as well as how to effectively
                use
                the tools, however powerful, at my disposal. My own brand and aesthetics come from years of stylizing
                and
                developing projects that follow key interface principles from the likes of Google, Apple, Microsoft, and
                others. The introduction of a more fun and bubbly approach to the sophistication and class of today is
                an
                overhaul to the digital landscape that evolved from replicating content from these brands.

                <br>
                <b>Music production</b>, especially in the last few years, has become a bit more personal to me. It best
                allows me
                to express my innermost feelings in a way other than words. It's turned from something I practice in my
                free
                time into a creative outlet. I've released some tracks over the years, and have continued producing my
                own
                music, but never on a set timeline or release schedule.
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>DJing and mixing</b>, on the other hand, is where my collaborative heart really beats (pun intended).
                It
                all
                changed for me when I discovered my musical role model, LP Giobbi. Her infectious energy and huge heart,
                as
                well as the work and teaching she does for others, just makes her an absolute powerhouse of inspiration
                in
                my book, and I strive to be as effortlessly awaesome as her! I am infatuated with house and dance music
                overall, with the likes of Sofi Tukker, Bob Moses, Gorgon City, and many others constantly on my
                rotation.
                <br>
                <br>
                Thanks for reading!
